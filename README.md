# Youtube Community Post Downloader
### Scuffed Edition

I couldn't find any youtube community post downloaders that also downloaded the post itself (not just the images), so I made one myself.
While the images are the main appeal, I wanted the context to go with them.
So. I coded it myself.

Downloads the posts, all of the text on the posts, as well as the images attached.
Currently does not work with Polls.


## How to use:
1. Collect all of the links directly to the posts
2. Put them into text file designated by Line 8 (The variable "urls")
3. Just run the script


Refer to Tutorial.mp4 that I included if you're still confused.
